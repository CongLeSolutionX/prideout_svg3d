    """Generates a triangle mesh for a sphere, rounded cube, or capsule.

    The ndivisions argument can be used to control the level of detail
    and should be between 0 and 5, inclusive.

    To create a sphere, simply omit the width/height/depth arguments.

    To create a capsule, set one of width/height/depth to a value
    greater than twice the radius. To create a cuboid, set two or more
    of these to a value greater than twice the radius.

    Returns a two-tuple: a numpy array of 3D vertex positions,
    and a numpy array of integer 3-tuples for triangle indices.
